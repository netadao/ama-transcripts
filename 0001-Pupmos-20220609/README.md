@Lil D#6969: I have several questions, so pick and choose whatever is appropriate to respond to. While I'm very interested in the question of blockchain for monetary/economic theory, I also see it as a social technology that can renew/enable public interest in concepts of government and alternative democratic configurations. Outside of a C++ class many years ago, I have no specific technical knowledge/training with any coding or blockchain stuff, so feel free to be as pedantic about Cosmos architecture as you can. :love:<br/><br/>General Cosmos SDK vs CW20 question: After Terra depeg, Ethan Buchman tweeted that DeFi also needs to mean ""definancialization,"" by which I take him to mean that blockchains can provide deep value to non-financialized (or, ideally non-financialized) applications: carbon emissions, voting systems, fake news, creative rights/intellectual property, social media censorship, records of all sorts, etc. Already, as if in answer to Bucky, we have REGEN and HOWL—one its own Cosmos chain, the other built on JUNO. Can you explain what difference it makes to these projects to be an independent Cosmos chain versus a CW token? And, in the broader scheme, do you see Cosmos as providing the tools and environment for these applications, where the ledger is tracking inviolable but non-financial (""esoteric""?) information? And what sorts of things, if any, still need to be built to make that possible?<br/><br/>NETA DAO question : I believe you once referred to NETA as a kind of cultural population snapshot of early JUNO stakers and voters; likewise, the tracking tool built by CamelJuno suggests NETA can be used as an ongoing 'demographic' snapshot, perhaps as a broad proxy for conviction or other relevant determinations. Do you think that NETA DAO could find ways to provide ongoing information to projects considering fairdrops? For example, I'm thinking that if tracking OG recipients' holding is valuable, could it also be worthwhile to get periodic snapshots of whether holders continued voting on proposals, and to see who joined the party after the drop and get a sense of their conviction/behavior as well?<br/><br/>LUNA-JUNO question: Are you excited about any particular projects/services migrating from Terra to Juno? Does USDC answer to all the needs met by UST for those projects?<br/><br/>JUNO question: Where would you like to see JUNO go over the next few years? Do smart contracts become business-to-business tools? Do they give NFTs new utilities? Tell me what the future holds, pupper. :happyDoggoRide: [discord msg link](https://discord.com/channels/963187793151012904/981615888665034762/983946001339531316)|reedon long queztion. pleez stann bi 🐾|Reading a long question.

If nothing goes wrong and you hit the timeline there is no positive because that was expected. If you don't it's a negative.<br/><br/>This is called a trade off matrix in game theory.|

But there are some things which are more effective when backed by a powerful team of core developers. Running public chain infrastructure enables us to do this sustainably with the best talent in the world.|"

|@Lil D#6969: One more long JUNO/Cosmos/DAO question from me: Given the different kinds of exploits different chains have had to deal with in recent months, it seems like there is room to improve code/dev accountability (more audits, insurance mechanisms, etc.), but also that there may be a need for more strictly political organizations (I've seen some enthusiasm for ideas such as a Cosmos Constitution or Bill of Rights, a kind of crypto-legal system) that could help adjudicate 'gray area' matters, establish a best practices for decentralization and anti-corruption, or even enforce remedies against certain violations. I know JUNO has already proposed sub-DAOs for managing certain limited aspects; do you see DAOs and sub-DAOs playing a bigger role in these broader inter-chain security efforts as the ecosystem matures and develops more sophisticated tools and mechanisms? and should there be a system of checks and balances for these as well?

Butt i fhink we can alsho looc at givin Veto power 2 certain entiteaz|Yes. At a baseline this exists in that the L1 Juno DAO is an admin on all of the SubDAO contracts. But I think we can also look at giving veto power to certain entities.|
